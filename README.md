# Online_Fir_Portal

This Project is to design a web module that will automatically update the status of an online registered FIR .  Often it can be found that due to the lethargic moves of the cops , a filed FIR is procrastinated. But this proposed module will automatically transfer the file to the higher officials if found unresponsed by the zonal level policemen. It will also show the taken steps by the cops in case of properly investigated and notify the user.
